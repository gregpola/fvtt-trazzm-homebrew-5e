4. Select Automated Animations from the list
5. Select Launch Menu
6. Select Menu Manager

--Safe Merge--
The suggested way to implement this if you have personally created automatic recognition settings is to export your existing animations somewhere safe, overwrite your Automatic Animations settings with this file, then merge your exported animations back in. If you don't have anything you want to keep, just overwrite everything with this.
