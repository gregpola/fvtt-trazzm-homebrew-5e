If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":2,"units":"hour"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"attribute","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Druid 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[{"_id":"9DAHUi59PWBalRc5","changes":[{"key":"macro.itemMacro","mode":0,"value":"@actor","priority":"20"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/creatures/magical/humanoid-silhouette-green.webp","label":"Wild Shape","origin":"Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.AjWCoZH8wxSQRWsC","transfer":false,"flags":{"dae":{"selfTarget":false,"stackable":"none","durationExpression":"","macroRepeat":"none","specialDuration":["zeroHP"],"transfer":false},"core":{"statusId":""},"dnd5e-helpers":{"rest-effect":"Ignore"},"ActiveAuras":{"isAura":false,"aura":"None","radius":null,"alignment":"","type":"","ignoreSelf":false,"height":false,"hidden":false,"displayTemp":false,"hostile":false,"onlyOnce":false}},"tint":null,"selectedKey":"macro.itemMacro"},{"_id":"zfDKrrPpyGdbJRVq","changes":[{"key":"data.resources.primary.label","mode":5,"value":"Wild Shape","priority":"20"},{"key":"data.resources.primary.max","mode":5,"value":"@classes.druid.levels > 19 ? 99 : 2","priority":"20"},{"key":"data.resources.primary.sr","mode":5,"value":"1","priority":"20"},{"key":"data.resources.primary.lr","mode":5,"value":"1","priority":"20"}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null},"icon":"icons/creatures/magical/humanoid-silhouette-green.webp","label":"Wild Shape uses","origin":"Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.AjWCoZH8wxSQRWsC","transfer":true,"flags":{"dae":{"selfTarget":false,"stackable":"none","durationExpression":"","macroRepeat":"none","specialDuration":[],"transfer":true},"core":{"statusId":""},"dnd5e-helpers":{"rest-effect":"Ignore"},"ActiveAuras":{"isAura":false,"aura":"None","radius":null,"alignment":"","type":"","ignoreSelf":false,"height":false,"hidden":false,"displayTemp":false,"hostile":false,"onlyOnce":false}},"tint":null,"selectedKey":["data.resources.primary.label","data.resources.primary.max","data.resources.primary.sr","data.resources.primary.lr"]}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"midi-qol":{"effectActivation":false},"midiProperties":{"nodam":false,"fulldam":false,"halfdam":false,"rollOther":false,"critOther":false,"magicdam":false,"magiceffect":false,"concentration":false,"toggleEffect":false},"itemacro":{"macro":{"_id":null,"name":"Wild Shape","type":"script","author":"5vlmE3uiS7OIQTEf","img":"icons/svg/dice-target.svg","scope":"global","command":"const version = \"0.1.0\";\nconst resourceName = \"Wild Shape\";\nconst cost = 1;\n\ntry {\n\tconst lastArg = args[args.length -

You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h4 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\"><strong>Ritual Casting</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Artificer 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"}}}

You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Ammo</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n<td>2g (20)</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>1 lb.</td>\n<td>(40/160)</td>\n<td>\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pistol</td>\n<td>150g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>3 lb.</td>\n<td>(60/240)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musket</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (20)</td>\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(120/480)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\n<td>250g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>5 lb.</td>\n<td>(80/320)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (5)</td>\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(15/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad News</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (5)</td>\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\n<td>25 lb.</td>\n<td>(200/800)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (1)</td>\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(30/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":null,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Gunslinger 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.yxTl7swV50fMPUFo]{Arcane Trickster}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.3o8wT64D872vi7qI]{Assassin}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.0Ak2AgIbu1ax4V8z]{Inquisitive}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.8DuZNtN5jLSewRHm]{Mastermind}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.EnrIeCBIvPEJyLz4]{Phantom}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.jTLsslKDLdxfbaoP]{Scout}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.coR0HlUCaljLz1v9]{Soulknife}</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.DnG2kneDj7nzRN2A]{Swashbuckler}</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.NN1ODUwY9fSIrojN]{Thief}</span></p>\n<p><em>Homebrew Archetypes</em></p>\n<p>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-subclasses.dDo7wfjHLHZi53Bu]{Shadowdancer}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Rogue 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"}}}
