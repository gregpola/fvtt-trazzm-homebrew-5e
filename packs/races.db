They have the typical dwarven appreciation for order, tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aesthetic or artistic value.</p>\n<p>Few duergar become adventurers, fewer still on the surface world, because they are a hidebound and suspicious race. Those who leave their subterranean cities are usually exiles. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a gray dwarf character.</p>\n<p>Duergar see themselves as the true manifestation of dwarven ideals, clever enough not to be taken in by the treacherous deceptions of Moradin and his false promises. Their period of enslavement and the revolt against the mind flayers led by their god, Laduguer, purged the influence of the other dwarven gods from their souls and thus made them into the superior race.</p>\n<p>Duergar have no appreciation for beauty, that ability having been erased from their minds by the mind flayers long ago and any thought of recapturing it obliterated by Moradin’s betrayal. The duergar lead bleak, grim lives devoid of happiness or satisfaction, but they see that as their defining strength — the root of duergar pride, as it were — rather than a drawback to be corrected.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-racial-traits.3ic05Jpgi7C1WOWl]{Superior Darkvision}</strong></p>\n<p>You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Once a hexblood undergoes this irreversible ritual, they emerge as a hag NPC no longer under the control of the hexblood’s player, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increases</strong></p>\n<p>When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1.
