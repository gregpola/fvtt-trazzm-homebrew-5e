In a moment the song of steel was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen’drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofAerenal\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Aerenal</h4>\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Aerenal is ruled by the Undying Court, a council of undead elves sustained by positive energy. The Undying Court wields godlike power and has protected your island home for thousands of years. The greatest heroes of your people join the Undying Court after death; if you achieve great things in your life, you too could achieve this immortality.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war. With this in mind, what has caused you to leave your island and wander the world?

In a moment the song of steel was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen’drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofAerenal\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Aerenal</h4>\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Aerenal is ruled by the Undying Court, a council of undead elves sustained by positive energy. The Undying Court wields godlike power and has protected your island home for thousands of years. The greatest heroes of your people join the Undying Court after death; if you achieve great things in your life, you too could achieve this immortality.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war. With this in mind, what has caused you to leave your island and wander the world? Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against the Undying Court?</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As one of the Aereni, think about your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{history}. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what’s your relationship with them?

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen’drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofValenar\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Valenar</h4>\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Your people are dedicated to the arts of war. Millenia ago, your ancestors fought an epic war against mighty giants. When they came to Khorvaire, they battled the champions of the goblin empire. The greatest heroes of those struggles live on after death, known as the <span class=\"Emphasis\">patron ancestors</span>. When you became an adult, one of the patron ancestors formed a bond with you. Now it is your duty to follow in the footsteps of your patron, living your life as they lived theirs, allowing this champion to live on through you. This is why your people constantly seek out conflict; you need to find challenges worthy of a hero.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">In creating a Valenar, think about your patron ancestor. Your class should reflect their class; if you’re a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. If you’re a ranger, was your ancestor a famous blademaster, or a stealthy hunter? Was your ancestor chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, it’s your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Each patron ancestor is tied to many Valenar: do you have a particular rival who channels the same ancestor, or one who channels a rival of your ancestor?</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">It’s also important to think about why you are traveling with a group of player characters instead of serving in a Valenar warband. Are you driven by visions from your patron ancestor? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors their legendary deeds? Do you seek vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-racial-traits.TSdHD7ef7ymaV1cR]{Darkvision}</b></p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You are no Dhakaani of old, and a mere twenty of you will bring no honor to the Taeri.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">The warlord hissed in fury, and his flail flashed in the firelight. The chain wrapped around Caerys’ blade but she twisted away. The flail flew into the darkness. She spun forward, her double blade weaving a circle of fire as she danced toward the chieftain. In a moment the song of steel was over.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground. With a contemptuous snap of her wrist, she flicked the blood from her blade into the eyes of the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Stunned]{stunned} onlookers. She smiled behind her spirit veil, counting the blades arrayed against her.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Quotation\"><span class=\"CharOverride-1\">“But forty will.”</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Elven culture began on the distant continent of Xen’drik. Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves rose up against the giants who ruled that land. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen’drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal. There they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. While neither of these cultures have much interest in human activities, a small number of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the years and have integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors. With centuries to devote to their studies, the elves are masters of their chosen crafts; at the same time, their society has changed very little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. As an elf, consider your relationship with the past. Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way forward?</p>\n<h4 id=\"ElvesofValenar\" class=\"Header-2\">Elves of Valenar</h4>\n<p class=\"Common-Text-First\">Your people are dedicated to the arts of war. Millenia ago, your ancestors fought an epic war against mighty giants. When they came to Khorvaire, they battled the champions of the goblin empire. The greatest heroes of those struggles live on after death, known as the <span class=\"Emphasis\">patron ancestors</span>. When you became an adult, one of the patron ancestors formed a bond with you. Now it is your duty to follow in the footsteps of your patron, living your life as they lived theirs, allowing this champion to live on through you. This is why your people constantly seek out conflict; you need to find challenges worthy of a hero.</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">In creating a Valenar, think about your patron ancestor. Your class should reflect their class; if you’re a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. If you’re a ranger, was your ancestor a famous blademaster, or a stealthy hunter? Was your ancestor chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, it’s your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Each patron ancestor is tied to many Valenar: do you have a particular rival who channels the same ancestor, or one who channels a rival of your ancestor?</p>\n<p class=\"Common-Text\">It’s also important to think about why you are traveling with a group of player characters instead of serving in a Valenar warband. Are you driven by visions from your patron ancestor? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors their legendary deeds? Do you seek vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-racial-traits.TSdHD7ef7ymaV1cR]{Darkvision}</b></p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.</p>\n<p>Your class’s “Quick Build” section offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You’re free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.</p>\n<p>If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.</p>\n<p>If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Creature Type</b></p>\n<p>Every creature in D&amp;D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the cure wounds spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature of the Construct type.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-racial-traits.0dEDTbSXPNilCYfL]{Creature Type}</b></p>\n<p>You are a Fey.</p>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>You are Medium or Small.
