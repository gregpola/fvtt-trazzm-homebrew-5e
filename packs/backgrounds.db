Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>A faceless character usually plays their persona — the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That’s all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d8</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I’m earnest and uncommonly direct.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I strive to have no personality — it’s easier to forget what’s hardly there.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I treasure a memento of the person or instance that set me upon my path.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I sleep just as much as I need to and on an unusual schedule.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I cultivate a single obscure hobby or study and eagerly discuss it at length.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I am ever learning how to be among others — when to stay quiet, when to laugh.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I behave like an extreme opposite of my persona.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>@UUID[Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-roll-tables.p8mOIJWxQbTKtkfM]{Faceless: Personality Trait}</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d6</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Justice.</strong> Place in society shouldn’t determine one’s access to what is right.

Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.</p><p>Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild’s coffers.</p><p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces.</p><hr /><h5>Baldur’s Gate Feature: Professional Courtesy</h5><p>You’re familiar with the city’s crews, their territories, and inter-crew politics. Choose one of the three districts of Baldur’s Gate: the Upper City, the Lower City, or the Outer City. This is the district where you conduct most of your business. Whenever you need information about something in one of that district’s neighborhoods, you can seek out crew members in that area and learn the local gossip. You can also gain unimpeded entry to nearly any bank, guild hall, place of business, workhouse, or crew meeting place in your district.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career.

One group’s con artist might be another’s revolutionary. Or maybe you’re just in it for yourself. In any case, characters with this background have a plan to hit the big time; all they need is audacity and a little time.</p><p>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts’ desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage.</p><p>You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment — nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust — can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale.

You’re skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.</p><p>Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur’s Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you’re a patriar.

Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City’s rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur’s Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.</p><p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.</p><p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p><p>What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position?

You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go.

As a result, it’s easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of how to operate the city’s mechanized cranes.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well.

You aren’t one of those folk.</p><p>You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.</p><p>Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you’re a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.</p><hr /><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Insight, Perception</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland</p><p><strong>Languages: </strong>One of your choice</p><p><strong>Equipment: </strong>One set of traveler’s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp</p><hr /><h5>Why Are You Here?</h5><p>A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location.</p><p>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.</p><p><strong>Evermeet.</strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland. Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.</p><p><strong>Halruaa.</strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic. Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.</p><p><strong>Kara-Tur.</strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin. The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.</p><p><strong>Mulhorand.</strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn. Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.</p><p><strong>Sossal.</strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white. Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.</p><p><strong>Zakhara.</strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have. You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.</p><p><strong>The Underdark.</strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child. If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d6</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Emissary</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Exile</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Fugitive</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Pilgrim</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Sightseer</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">Wanderer</td></tr></tbody></table><p>@UUID[Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-roll-tables.NWL3PsbcSQkFoH55]{Far Traveler: Reason}</p><hr /><h5>Feature: All Eyes on You</h5><p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign.

If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the acolyte might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.</p><p>While some might think it strange to find hermits in a bustling city, others know that sometimes the most profound solitude exists in the midst of a crowd. Baldur’s Gate holds a handful of souls who manage to find isolation amid its tumult.</p><p>You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone—for a formative part of your life.

You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked.

Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d8</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Specialty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Officer</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Scout</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Infantry</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cavalry</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Healer</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Quartermaster</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Standard bearer</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>@UUID[Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-roll-tables.jfoNp7m8ep8VBsVN]{Soldier: Specialty}</p><hr /><h5>Feature: Military Rank</h5><p>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</p><hr /><h5>Baldur’s Gate Feature: City Guard</h5><p>You may choose to currently serve in either the Flaming Fist or the Watch. If you do, you have responsibilities related to your post. For as long as you perform these responsibilities, you gain benefits. If you stop performing your responsibilities, though, you lose access to the benefits and might suffer further fallout. Should you lose these benefits, you may regain them by having an unpleasant conversation with your commanding officer and fulfilling your responsibilities for a month.</p><p><em><strong>Flaming Fist.</strong></em> If you serve in the Flaming Fist, once every ten days, you must report to the Seatower of Balduran for training, and you’re required to take a regular shift patrolling either the Lower City or the Outer City. In return, you have access to the Flaming Fist’s fortresses and a direct line of communication with Flaming Fist officers and other soldiers. You can also pass through the city’s gates without question — although you can’t bring guests into the Upper City as a member of the Watch might. Additionally, you’re always welcome at the Three Old Kegs, where the Three Old Toads are glad to greet you with a smile and a mug of ale.</p><p><em><strong>The Watch.</strong></em> If you serve in the Watch, you’re required to conduct a regular patrol in the Upper City or take a regular shift at its gates, and must report for training in the Watch Citadel once every ten days. In return, you have access to the Citadel and a direct line of communication with Watch officers and officials. Your word carries considerable weight in the High Hall, and most establishments in the Citadel Streets neighborhood are happy to give you and your friends free meals. Additionally, you can escort people into the Upper City without question, regardless of whether they are patriars or have Watch tokens. Outside the Upper City, however, most people regard you with suspicion, and you generally get a chilly reception while in uniform.</p><hr /><h5>Baldur’s Gate Feature: Loyalty Test</h5><p>You’ve had enough dealings with crooked soldiers that you can spot the behaviors common to corrupt guards and military officers a mile away. While awareness of such corruption doesn’t equate to evidence of it, and your sense certainly isn’t foolproof, your instinct proves a useful starting point when determining who might take a bribe, who might turn a blind eye to a crime, or who might have criminal connections. You can also use this sense to get a feeling about who might fulfill their duties strictly by the book.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d8</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I’m always polite and respectful.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I’m haunted by memories of war.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction’s operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don’t merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart.</p><p>As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities.</p><p><strong>The Harpers:</strong> Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers’ ideals.</p><p><strong>The Order of the Gauntlet:</strong> One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order’s ideals, and the clergy of the order’s patron gods.</p><p><strong>The Emerald Enclave:</strong> Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature.</p><p><strong>The Lords’ Alliance:</strong> On one level, the agents of the Lords’ Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance’s ideals.</p><p><strong>The Zhentarim:</strong> In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren’t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.</p><hr /><h5>Feature: Safe Haven</h5><p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Use the tables for the acolyte background below as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words “faith” and “faction” to be interchangeable.)</p><p>Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d8</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I see omens in every event and action.

You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d8</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I never pass up a friendly wager.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>@UUID[Compendium.fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-roll-tables.JTF93vVbEjQO4G2K]{Sailor: Personality Trait}</p><table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:15%;text-align:center\">d6</th><th class=\"left wrap\" style=\"text-align:left\">Ideal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\"><strong>Respect.</strong> </span>The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between the captain and crew.

A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children.

Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family’s behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy?</p><p>Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of —there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p><p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p><p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p><p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p><p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p><p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p><p>The patriars of Baldur’s Gate live in the Upper City, where they host grand galas and flaunt cosmopolitan fashions, but are walled off from the poverty and squalor of the less fortunate districts and their neighborhoods. Although they might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like for the poor outside their own doorsteps.</p><p>This combination of worldly savvy and local blindness characterizes almost all the nobility of Baldur’s Gate. As a result, for those who wish to play patriars, the Patriar feature below replaces the Position and Privilege feature of the noble background. Those who wish to use the background’s standard feature might have gained their standing in Baldur’s Gate from business rather than inheritance.</p><hr /><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>History, Persuasion</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>One type of gaming set</p><p><strong>Languages: </strong>One of your choice</p><p><strong>Equipment: </strong>A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</p><hr /><h5>Feature: Position of Privilege</h5><p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p><hr /><h5>Variant Feature: Retainers</h5><p>If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p><p>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.</p><hr /><h5>Baldur’s Gate Feature: Patriar</h5><p>As a member of one of the elite families of Baldur’s Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate’s nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted.

Although they might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like for the poor outside their own doorsteps.</p><p>This combination of worldly savvy and local blindness characterizes almost all the nobility of Baldur’s Gate. As a result, for those who wish to play patriars, the Patriar feature below replaces the Position and Privilege feature of the noble background. Those who wish to use the background’s standard feature might have gained their standing in Baldur’s Gate from business rather than inheritance.</p><p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p><p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p><p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p><p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p><p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p><p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p><div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"><p></p></div><dl><dt><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Persuasion}</p></dt><dt><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</p></dt><dt><p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p></dt><dt><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</p></dt></dl><blockquote><p id=\"position-of-privilege\"><strong>FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE</strong></p><p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you.

One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p><p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion.

Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</p><p><strong>Knights of the Unicorn.</strong> The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Knights of Myth Drannor.</strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p><p><strong>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</strong> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide","advancement":[]},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1673042299659,"modifiedTime":1688152939636,"lastModifiedBy":"5vlmE3uiS7OIQTEf"}}

You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You’ve survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.</p><p>You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days.

Now, you look forward to fighting foes and reaping even greater rewards as an adventurer. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events on the battlefield. You might have served with a large outfit such as the Zhentarim or the soldiers of Mintarn, or a smaller band of sell-swords, maybe even more than one. (See the “Mercenaries of the North” sidebar for a collection of possibilities.)</p><p>Now you’re looking for something else, perhaps greater reward for the risks you take, or the freedom to choose your own activities. For whatever reason, you’re leaving behind the life of a soldier for hire, but your skills are undeniably suited for battle, so now you fight on in a different way.</p><hr /><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Athletics, Persuasion</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies: </strong>One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)</p><p><strong>Equipment: </strong>A uniform of your company (traveler’s clothes in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a pouch containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp)</p><hr /><blockquote><h5>Mercenaries of the North</h5><p>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.</p><p><strong>The Chill.</strong> The cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization.</p><p><strong>Silent Rain.</strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested.</p><p><strong>The Bloodaxes.</strong> Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.</p></blockquote><hr /><h5>Feature: Mercenary Life</h5><p>You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including the names and reputations of its commanders and leaders, and who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see “Practicing a Profession” under “Downtime Activities” in chapter 8 of the Player’s Handbook).</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Use the tables for the soldier background below as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary.</p><p>Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with.

Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City’s rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur’s Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.</p><p>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and lawlessness. You’ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.</p><p>You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.</p><p>Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?</p><p>What were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate?

When you are in a settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</p><hr /><h5>Baldur’s Gate Feature: Smuggler’s Sense</h5><p>You’re familiar with the docks of Baldur’s Gate, the movement of inspectors and tax collectors, the way cargo and coin flows. As a result, it’s easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of how to operate the city’s mechanized cranes.</p><hr /><h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5><p>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well.
