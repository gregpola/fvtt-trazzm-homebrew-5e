Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City’s rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur’s Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.</p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span class=\"No-Break\">ackground.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span class=\"No-Break\"> homeland.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span class=\"No-Break\">r society.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span class=\"No-Break\">ork magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa’s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span class=\"No-Break\"> of magic.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn’t your true ethnicity, because that’s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span class=\"No-Break\">ur origin.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span class=\"No-Break\"> was over.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span class=\"No-Break\">of Faerûn.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Those who leave behind Mulhorand’s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span class=\"No-Break\">your home.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span class=\"No-Break\"> in white.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span class=\"No-Break\">important.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, “To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.” Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn’t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span class=\"No-Break\"> you have.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span class=\"No-Break\">n deities.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">The </span><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place—but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span class=\"No-Break\">e a child.</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren’t a native, your reason for leaving “home” probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span class=\"No-Break\">situation.</span></p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <blockquote> <h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Feature: All Eyes on You</h5> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign.

Although they might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like for the poor outside their own doorsteps.</p> <p>This combination of worldly savvy and local blindness characterizes almost all the nobility of Baldur’s Gate. As a result, for those who wish to play patriars, the Patriar feature below replaces the Position and Privilege feature of the noble background. Those who wish to use the background’s standard feature might have gained their standing in Baldur’s Gate from business rather than inheritance.</p> <p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p> <p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p> <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p> <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p> <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p> <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <dl> <dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Persuasion}</dt> <dt><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</dt> <dt><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</dt> <dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp</dt> </dl> <blockquote> <p id=\"position-of-privilege\"><strong>FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE</strong></p> <p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p> <p><strong>BALDUR’S GATE FEATURE: PATRIAR</strong></p> <p>As a member of one of the elite families of Baldur’s Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate’s nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others’ without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you — at least until you make some effort to expose it.</p> </blockquote> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Variant Noble: Knight</h5> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p> <p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart — in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could<span class=\"No-Break\"> be your bond.)</span></p> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <blockquote> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>VARIANT FEATURE: RETAINERS</strong></p> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If your character has a noble background, you may select this background feature instead of Position of Privilege.</p> <p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body-Last--apply-at-last-paragraph-\">You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p> </blockquote> <div class=\"line character height1 marginTop20 marginBottom20\"> </div> <h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5> <p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.</p> <table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\"> <thead> <tr> <th>d8</th> <th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">I don’t like to get my hands dirty, and I won’t be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td class=\"left wrap\">Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.

The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.</p> <p>Though the term “knight” conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don’t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren’t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order’s cause.</p> <p>The “Knightly Orders of Faerûn” sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.</p> <p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Persuasion}, plus one from among @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Nature}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Religion}, as appropriate for your order</p> <p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set or musical instrument</p> <p><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</p> <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of traveler’s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Suggested Characteristics</strong></p> <p>Use the tables for the soldier background in the <a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\"><em>Player’s Handbook</em></a> as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.</p> <p>Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight’s ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one’s order.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF FAERÛN</strong></p> <p>Many who rightfully call themselves “knight” earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor’s Eternal Order or Mystra’s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word “knight” think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Unicorn.</strong></em> The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur’s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue’s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p> <p><strong><em>Knights of Myth Drannor.</em></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they’ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p> <p><em><strong>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</strong></em> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe’s ethos is the nobility’s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p> </blockquote><p></p><h2>Knightly Regard</h2><p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share those ideals.</p><p>This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide","advancement":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Most are small-scale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds.

Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few city-states in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civ<span class=\"No-Break\">ilization.</span> <br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Silent Rain.</span></strong> Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like.

(If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your DM to create one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bdad7c8e-aee4-4947-a08f-7e4256f036df\"><strong>Skills: </strong>any two</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bdad7c8e-aee4-4947-a08f-7e4256f036df\"><strong>Languages or Tools Proficiencies: </strong>any two</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","advancement":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"5vlmE3uiS7OIQTEf":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"30239099727eeaec682b20e8fe957e6f4a6c02a7","sourceId":"Item.wZNE7O8LuQMKDJD7"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.wZNE7O8LuQMKDJD7"}},"_id":"S98kt3xWTCraCoSX"}
