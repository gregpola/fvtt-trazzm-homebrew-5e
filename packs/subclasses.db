You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Ammo</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n<td>2g (20)</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>1 lb.</td>\n<td>(40/160)</td>\n<td>\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pistol</td>\n<td>150g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>3 lb.</td>\n<td>(60/240)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musket</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (20)</td>\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(120/480)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\n<td>250g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>5 lb.</td>\n<td>(80/320)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (5)</td>\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(15/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad News</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (5)</td>\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\n<td>25 lb.</td>\n<td>(200/800)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (1)</td>\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(30/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.HBQRLcPAtinUOL50]{Adept Marksman}</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Trick Shots.</i></b><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed under “Trick Shots” below.

Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} of you or another creature of your choice. The target is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.FM3Qvr85SUA1tOTG]{Mantle of Whispers}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona.

This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}) check contested by your Charisma (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Deception}) check.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On a failed saving throw, the target is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw.

When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.</li>\n<li>The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.</li>\n<li>You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.5HJZLTBsRjsWUsxw]{Awakened Spellbook}</b></p>\n<p><em>2nd-level Order of Scribes feature </em></p>\n<p>Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your spellbook.</p>\n<p>While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</li>\n<li>When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in your spellbook, which magically alters the spell’s formula for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell slot you expend.</li>\n<li>When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell’s normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you’re attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook’s consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.IqlrxaStsvpWsdWp]{Manifest Mind}</b></p>\n<p><em>6th-level Order of Scribes feature </em></p>\n<p>You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice).</p>\n<p>While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{darkvision} with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share with you what it sees and hears (no action required).</p>\n<p>Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind’s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects.</p>\n<p>The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts dispel magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind as a bonus action. Once you conjure the mind, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.xZ6Xruka2qpV5SR2]{Master Scrivener}</b></p>\n<p><em>10th-level Order of Scribes feature</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll.</p>\n<p>The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell’s power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.</p>\n<p>You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.UFvnFcDDjntx2BXE]{One with the Word}</b></p>\n<p><em>14th-level Order of Scribes feature </em></p>\n<p>Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person, you have advantage on all Intelligence (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Arcana}) checks, as the spellbook helps you remember magical lore.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook’s mind is manifested, you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the roll’s total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren’t enough spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the spellbook. Once you use this reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112","identifier":"order-of-scribes","classIdentifier":"wizard","advancement":[{"_id":"c18p5r624t5p0h45","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.NoUhNa5KMyFa08tI","Compendium.world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.5HJZLTBsRjsWUsxw"]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"t3kzijjbpgphrjnu","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.IqlrxaStsvpWsdWp"]},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"i03y757mrobq1ps5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.xZ6Xruka2qpV5SR2"]},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"goc36ue3h7s9s0h2","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.UFvnFcDDjntx2BXE"]},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"saves":["int","wis"]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in<span class=\"No-Break\"> a spellbook.</span></p>\n\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.Lh5TwDDn4GDlumci]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

While @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Restrained]{restrained} by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} by you for 1 minute. While @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).</em></strong> This rune’s magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Poisoned]{poisoned}, and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).</em></strong> Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.

Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.

In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet).

The fog moves with you, remaining centered on you and making its area heavily obscured. You and each creature within 5 feet of you instead treat the area as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners, and cannot be dispersed unless you choose to end this effect (no action required).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fury of the Tides.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rules Tip: Visibility</strong></p>\n<p>Fog and other effects can obscure vision for you, your enemies, and your allies. When you heavily obscure an area using your Marine Layer Channel Divinity option, all creatures within the area have their vision completely blocked, and creatures outside the area can’t see in. Creatures that can’t see automatically fail ability checks that require sight. Also, attack rolls against creatures that can’t see have advantage, and their own attack rolls have disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Creatures in a lightly obscured area have disadvantage only on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-test-5e-class-features.XN3M0dEgpnFUeHtr]{Oath Spells}</b></p>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Open Seas Spells table.
