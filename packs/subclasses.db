The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm.

If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost.

Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard’s reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em>3rd-Level College of Whispers Feature</em></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.LYbJBfTEJTue6HbI]{Psychic Blades (College of Whispers)}</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature’s mind.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em>3rd-Level College of Whispers Feature</em></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.8WRkiqoQamHUiEWm]{Words of Terror}</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} of you or another creature of your choice. The target is @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><em>6th-Level College of Whispers Feature</em></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.TurjzEXjGlQT9GVQ]{Mantle of Whispers}</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a humanoid’s persona.

This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn’t include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}) check contested by your Charisma (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Deception}) check.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you.

It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so.

One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail.

The Order of the Lycan is a proud group of blood hunters who undergo “the Taming”—the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member of the order, for those who do not already carry the curse before seeking this path. These hunters then use the magic of their blood to harness the power of the monster they harbor, without losing themselves to it. Using intense will and secret blood magic rituals, members of the Order of the Lycan learn to control and unleash their hybrid forms for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor-sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to their own hunger.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>The Burden of Lycanthropy</strong></span></p>\n<p>Those inducted into the Order of the Lycan choose this path with conviction, understanding the terrible weight it imposes on them and the challenges it brings. Where most afflicted by the curse of lycanthropy grow wicked, deranged, and even murderous, Lycan blood hunters accept the gifts of the beast while maintaining control through intense training and the power of their blood magic. A member of the Order of the Lycan cannot spread their curse through blood unless they wish to, and one of the most sacred oaths of this order is to never infect another creature without the order’s sanction.</p>\n<p>If a member of the Order of the Lycan is ever cured of their lycanthropic curse, it brings terrible shame to their name and the order. Members who have been cleansed against their will readily return to the order to undergo a renewed initiation of the Taming, reintroducing the curse to their bodies and restoring their honor.</p>\n<p>Lycanthropy comes in many forms bound to specific beasts, with wolf, bear, tiger, boar, and rat the best-known variations. The particular strain of the lycanthropic curse defines the physical traits that manifest in a Lycan blood hunter’s hybrid transformation, even as the benefits the curse bestows remain relatively uniform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>3rd-Level Order of the Lycan Feature</em></p>\n<p><strong>@Compendium[fvtt-trazzm-homebrew-5e.homebrew-class-features.qm5UBvj0Ljon1mud]{Heightened Senses}</strong></p>\n<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the improved senses of a natural predator.

Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil.

Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.</p>\n<p><strong>Wisdom.</strong> Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good.
