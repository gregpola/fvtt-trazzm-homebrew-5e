/*
    You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration.
    The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured.

    If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or
    ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat
    surface have a depth of 5 feet.

    The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving
    throw or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

    A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.
    If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

    The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to
    any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
