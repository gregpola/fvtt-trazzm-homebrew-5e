/*
	You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube
	from that point for the Duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

	If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or
	ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over
	a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

	Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving
	throw. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

	A creature Restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it
	succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

	The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to
	any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
