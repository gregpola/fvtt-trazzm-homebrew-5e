/*
    Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for
    the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.

    When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a
    failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spellâ€™s
    area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

    Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
