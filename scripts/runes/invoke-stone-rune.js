/*
    When a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and
    force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is Charmed by you for 1
    minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy
    stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once
    you invoke this rune, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
