/*
    With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check
    while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any enemy’s line
    of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

    On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total, which is the
    DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

    You stop being hidden immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an
    enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.
